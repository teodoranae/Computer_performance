# Computer performance

This web scraping project identifies the top 3 performing computers each year based on data from [top500.org](https://www.top500.org/). It visualizes their performance over time and also plots the yearly average performance in order to highlight broader trends in computing power.

The project uses BeautifulSoup (bs4) and http.client for data extraction.
